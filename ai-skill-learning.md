# Goal
Build practical AI skills for real work within 8–12 weeks using a sustainable routine.

# Quick Hook (Real‑World Pain)
If AI feels overwhelming and you keep saving links but never ship anything, this plan is for you.

# Why This Works (Principle)
- Small, shipped projects beat endless tutorials.
- Active recall plus repetition builds usable skill.
- Weekly scope pruning prevents burnout.

# The 3‑Step Daily Routine (Start Today)
1. **10‑minute input**: one short concept or tool update.
2. **15‑minute build**: apply it to a tiny real task.
3. **5‑minute log**: record what worked and what broke.

# Time‑Boxed Outcomes (What to Expect)
- **Week 1:** A daily habit and a small working demo.
- **Week 4:** 2–3 reusable mini‑projects.
- **Week 8:** A portfolio‑ready workflow you can repeat.

# Agent Loop
- Curate daily AI updates (tools, papers, tutorials).
- Extract 3 actionable ideas and 1 small implementation path.
- Generate a daily build prompt and checklist.

# Human‑Agent Loop
- Human selects weekly focus: model use, automation, or workflow.
- Agent creates daily micro‑tasks and review prompts.
- Human reviews output and keeps only the useful steps.

# Community Loop (Optional)
- Share weekly mini‑projects and learnings.
- Collect feedback on what was most useful or confusing.
- Update the weekly focus list based on community votes.

# Daily and Weekly Cadence
- Daily: 30 minutes total (10 input + 15 build + 5 log).
- Weekly: 60 minutes review + scope reset.

# Common Pitfalls
- Consuming content without building.
- Starting projects too large.
- Skipping weekly review and scope reset.
