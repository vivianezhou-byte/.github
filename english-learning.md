# Goal
Build usable English for real-world communication in 8–12 weeks with a sustainable routine.

# Quick Hook (Real‑World Pain)
If you can read English but freeze in standups, meetings, or async chats, this plan is for you.

# Why This Works (Principle)
- Frequency beats intensity: short daily practice builds automaticity.
- Active recall beats passive input: speaking + self-check accelerates fluency.
- Small loops compound: daily micro‑practice + weekly review creates momentum.

# The 3‑Step Daily Routine (Start Today)
1. **5‑minute input**: one short article or video + transcript.  
2. **10‑minute speaking**: answer 3 prompts out loud.  
3. **5‑minute recall**: repeat the 3 hardest phrases.  

# Time‑Boxed Outcomes (What to Expect)
- **Week 1:** A daily routine that you can finish in 30 minutes or less.
- **Week 4:** Noticeably smoother short responses in daily work conversations.
- **Week 8:** Better confidence in meetings and quick explanations.

# Agent Loop
- Curate daily input from 3 sources: short articles, short videos, and transcripts.
- Extract 10 high-frequency phrases and 5 minimal grammar patterns per day.
- Generate micro‑practice: 5 short prompts + 1 shadowing script.
- Compile a daily learning digest with examples and translations.

# Human‑Agent Loop
- Human chooses focus track each week: speaking, listening, writing, or vocabulary.
- Human reviews the daily digest, marks 3 items as “must retain.”
- Agent schedules spaced reviews based on retention difficulty.

# Community Loop (Optional)
- Share weekly “top 10 phrases + 5 sentence patterns” to community.
- Collect feedback on which patterns were most useful.
- Iterate the daily prompt list based on community votes.

# Daily and Weekly Cadence
- Daily: 15 minutes input, 10 minutes micro‑practice, 5 minutes recall.
- Weekly: 30 minutes review, 10-minute summary video or post.

# Common Pitfalls
- Too many sources, not enough repetition.
- Passive consumption without recall.
- No weekly review cycle.
