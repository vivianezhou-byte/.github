# Goal
Pass a high‑stakes exam within a fixed deadline using a minimal, repeatable system.

# Quick Hook (Real‑World Pain)
If you’re buried in materials and still don’t know what to study today, this plan is for you.

# Why This Works (Principle)
- Time‑boxed targets prevent endless scope creep.
- Active recall beats re‑reading.
- Weekly re‑prioritization keeps you on track.

# The 3‑Step Daily Routine (Start Today)
1. **10‑minute input**: review the weakest topic from yesterday.  
2. **10‑minute recall**: answer 5–10 quick questions without notes.  
3. **5‑minute update**: log gaps and push them into tomorrow’s target list.  

# Time‑Boxed Outcomes (What to Expect)
- **Week 1:** A stable daily rhythm you can complete in 30 minutes.  
- **Week 4:** Clear priority list and measurable weak‑area reduction.  
- **Week 8:** Confidence in exam‑style questions and pacing.  

# Agent Loop
- Build a topic map from the syllabus.
- Generate daily targets based on days remaining and total content volume.
- Create quick quizzes for weak topics and update a “priority list.”

# Human‑Agent Loop
- Human sets the exam date and available daily hours.
- Agent outputs a daily target plan with review limits.
- Human reviews performance and overrides priority if needed.

# Community Loop (Optional)
- Share weekly “top weak areas” and “most common mistakes.”
- Gather peer tips for efficient memorization and review.

# Daily and Weekly Cadence
- Daily: 25 minutes study block + 10 minutes recall + 5 minutes review.
- Weekly: 60 minutes full review + re‑prioritize topics.

# Common Pitfalls
- Unrealistic daily targets.
- Ignoring review backlog.
- Over‑collecting resources without finishing them.
